# BirGet
It is a car-sharing app system. It was developed in Android Studio and Java. I can say that the system and design of BirGet have some same technical aspects as BlaBlaCar. We used Firebase Realtime Database and Firebase Storage. BirGet has a two-section: for drivers and for customers. In the driver's section, the user fills the form and create a new travel trip and start to find the customers. In the customer's section, the user wants to find the trips which are suitable for his or her criterias. We developed a variety of pages for conducting the Most Valuable Product:
  1. Splash Screen.
  2. Register Form.
  3. Login Form.
  4. Dashboard.
  5. Google Map.
  6. Trip Find Form.
  7. Recycler View with Trip.
  8. Profile.
  9. Settings.
  10. Customer admin.
  11. Finder admin.

There is plenty of algorithms and data structures that we used in this program. For example, we use an array, linked list and heap. We also use a variety of algorithms, such as greedy algorithms, sort algorithms, search algorithms and Dijkstra's shortest path algorithms. You can use all of these codes in any project. If you want to build a car-sharing app, you can use this code.  Good luck!
Sincerely, Huseyn Aliyev.
